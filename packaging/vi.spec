%description
Compared to most of its many clones, the traditional vi is a rather small
program just with its extremely powerful editing interface, but lacking fancy
features like multiple undo, multiple screens, or syntax highlighting.
This port of vi has generally preserved the original style, terminal control,
and feature set. It adds support for international character sets, including
multibyte encodings such as UTF-8, and some minor enhancements that were not
present in BSD vi 3.7, but had been included in later vi versions for System V
or in POSIX.2.
